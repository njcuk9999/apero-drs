# Update Note Summary - Version 0.7.035

Date: 2020-09-10

## Updates since Version 0.6.131

- database
    - complete code change on how databases are handled. Currently supported
      databases are
        - calibration database (instead of master_calib_SPIROU.py)
        - telluric database (instead of master_tellu_SPIROU.py)
        - file database (instead of index.fits files in each dir)
        - log database (instead of index.fits files in each dir)
        - object database (instead of object_query_list.fits)
    - still to do
        - language database (instead of the language csv files)
        - param database (to help load parameters faster?)

- processing
    - moving to use multiprocess.Pool instead of multiprocess.Process (should
      speed up how we handle jobs on multiple cores) - requires classes be
      pickle-able

- object resolution
    - now done in preprocessing (was extraction)
    - googlesheet master list of Gaia ID / RV / Teff - human editable
    - then use Gaia ID to crossmatch with Gaia/SIMBAD
    - fall back to header (properly)
    - header keys for all parameters DRS will use (+ source) separate from
      input header keys

- tellurics
    - added header keys to template file:
        - MTPNFILE: Number of files used to make template
        - MTP_HASH: Unique hash for input template files
        - MTP_TIME: Time template was created
    - added header keys to mk_tellu files:
        - MKTTEMPN: Number of files used to make template
        - MKTTEMPH: Unique hash for input template files
        - MKTTEMPT: Time template was created
    - added header keys to fit_tellu files:
        - FTTTEMPN: Number of files used to make template
        - FTTTEMPH: Unique hash for input template files
        - MKTTEMPT: Time template was created

- general
    - all functions should be pickle-able and python typed and have doc strings
    - reorganisation of modulular structure - minimize circular importing
      minimize when certain modules are imported/not imported
