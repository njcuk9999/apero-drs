# Update Note Summary - Version 0.7.000

Date: 2020-09-10

## Updates since Version 0.6.131


- database
    - complete code change on how databases are handled. Currently supported
      databases are
        - calibration database (instead of master_calib_SPIROU.py)
    - still to do
        - telluric database (instead of master_tellu_SPIROU.py)
        - file database (instead of index.fits files in each dir)
        - log database (instead of index.fits files in each dir)
        - object database (instead of object_query_list.fits)
        - language database (instead of the language csv files)
        - param database (to help load parameters faster?)

- processing
    - moving to use multiprocess.Pool instead of multiprocess.Process (should
      speed up how we handle jobs on multiple cores) - requires classes be
      pickle-able


- general
    - all functions should be pickle-able and python typed and have doc strings
    - reorganisation of modulular structure - minimize circular importing
      minimize when certain modules are imported/not imported
