Update Notes - Version 0.3.001


1) Moved where pre-processed files are saved (now saved in the TMP folder instead of RAW) - Defined in config.py by "DRS_DATA_WORKING"

      [REQUIRES RE-PRE-PROCESSING TO WORK]*

2) Pre-processing now creates an index.fits (FITS table) with listing of key parameters used by off_listing (for speed up)
  - parameters are [FILENAME, DATE-OBS, UTC-OBS, OBSTYPE, EXPTIME, SCCCAS_P, SBCREF_P, SBCDEN_P]

      [REQUIRES RE-PRE-PROCESSING TO WORK]*

3) All recipes now return outputs with some additional header keys. These are:
    - DRSOUTID (kw_OUTPUT)   - stores a description of the output
    - DRS_EOUT (kw_EXT_TYPE)  - stores a description of the extraction input (DPRTYPE)
   These are used to check inputs of recipes that use DRS outputs (e.g. cal_drift, cal_ccf, pol_spirou etc)

      [REQUIRES RE-REDUCING PRODUCTS TO WORK]**

4) All recipes now index their outputs in an addition "index.fits" FITS table used by off_listing for display files and the drift recipes to find all fp_fp (or hc_hc) files
   Note that without this file drift recipes take a long time to read all files (and if you have hundreds of files would take a significant amount of time) the index.fits means
   this process takes seconds

      [REQUIRES RE-REDUCING PRODUCTS TO WORK]**

5) New wavelength solution (By Melissa) is now on the calibration database 

      [REQUIRES RESET OF CALIB DATABASE TO WORK]***
