# Update Note Summary - Version 0.3.037


## TODO

### In progress


- add all functions doc strings
- add in `dark_fp` correction
- fix headers for having bad wave and loc keys (remove?)
- fix s1d for `FP_FP` and `HC_HC` they need updating after wave sol produced
- finish `obj_spec_spirou` and `obj_pol_spirou` [Do not use them now]
- output files like CFHT (e.fits, p.fits, v.fits etc)
- go through all summary plots and decide which plots, write figure captions,
  improve plots, write quality control description, decide which header keys to print
- display func for all functions
- add doc strings to all functions, descriptions to all constants, review all
  constant min/max/dtypes
- add more debug printouts
- deal with all python warnings
- write documentation


###  As soon as possible

- add `plot== 3` (all debug plots shown) and `plot==4` (all debug plots saved) modes
- move `object_query_list.fits` to `calibDB`
- write  paper
- setup instrument tool
- add exposure meter recipes (`cal_exposuremeter_spirou.py`)
- Windows compatibility
- output in form required for CFHT/CADC (discussion required)
- co-production of e2ds and e2dsff
- uncertainty propagation
- proper SNR calculation
- add `cal_drift` recipe?
- NIRPS integration
- uncertainty propagation
- data separate download from DRS
- add EA mask generation from templates
- add EA template matching


## Known Issues

### Recipes

- s1d for FP_FP and HCONE_HCONE files does not have the updated wave solution
  as files are extracted before wave solution produced
- wave solution and loc solutions are never updated in headers once a new
  solution is present - should they be? should they be removed from headers?
- FP of fiber C is contaminating fiber A and B - Etienne has a solution, but
  far from being implemented yet
- CCF still showing problems --> due to not weighting the orders, but cannot
  do this per file as must have the same weights
- BERV file gets locked - WHY?


### External

- can't use barycorrpy --> update astropy (version 4.0) and barycorrpy (version 0.3))
