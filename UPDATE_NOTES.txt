Update Note Summary - Version 0.3.027 (Since 0.3.017)

Not done/not finished/to do:

- cal_WAVE_E2DS/cal_HC_E2DS versions merging [Melissa]
- cal_WAVE_E2DS_EA does not work with new extract (4b) Why?
- integrate telluric use of different wave solutions [Neil + Etienne]
- drift code compatibility [Francois]
- add the drift to cal_CCF [Francois]

Done:

- Integrated Etiennes "shape finding" algorithm
    - adds new recipe "cal_SHAPE_spirou.py" - needed to run extraction
    - cal_SHAPE_spirou.py works like cal_SLIT_spirou.py but produces a 2D
      "shape" (dx offset) file
    - cal_extract_RAW_spirou updated to support extraction modes "4a" and "4b"
      which are equivalent to extraction modes "3c" and "3d" but with the tilt
      replaced by the dxshift (actually image is straighted before-hand in the
      case of "4a" and "4b" then extraction is 1 pixel wide in x and folded
      along the y direction for A/B/C
    - NOTE: Must set "ic_extract_type = 4b" (or 4a) to work with extraction!!!
    - added "un-sum" extraction output (E2DSLL) to see what the extraction
      is doing

- cal_HC_E2DS_EA_spirou: resolution & line profiles saved as outputs

- Fix issue #464: DRIFT codes input files now allowed:
    - Fiber AB/A/B: FP_FP
    - Fiber AB/A/B: HCONE_HCONE
    - Fiber AB/A/B: HCTWO_HCTWO
    - Fiber C: FP_FP and OBJ_FP
    - Fiber C: HCONE_HCONE and OBJ_HCONE
    - Fiber C: HCTWO_HCTWO and OBJ_HCTWO

- Fix issue #468: Wave solution functions merged
    - now should ONLY use "GetWaveSolution" in recipes (though internal
      functions exist to do the individual operations like get wave params
      from header or generate wave map from wave params etc.
    - Now prints where the wave solution was taken from FILE/HEADER/CALIBDB and
      the associated filename
    - Note that to force fiber type (when using calibDB) need to use
      "fiber={FIBER}" otherwise fiber will be fiber = p['FIBER']
      (i.e. WAVE_{fiber} is used in calib DB)

- Fix issue #471: Filenames of all inputs added to headers of outputs
  (and passed to future outputs) i.e. new header keys are:
        - DARKFILE
        - BADFILE1
        - BADFILE2
        - LOCOFILE
        - TILTFILE
        - SHAPFILE
        - BLAZFILE
        - FLATFILE
        - EXTRFILE
        - REFRFILE
        - WAVEFILE
        - INFILE
        - HCFILE
        - FPFILE
    These can of course be changes as with other header keys in
    spirouKeywords.py (located in directory .../INTROOT/SpirouDRS/spirouConfig/)

- Fixed issue #475: pre-procesing now always adds DPRTYPE even when file not
  identified (as pp file is still made and can still be extracted)

- Constant added to force re-computation of line list
  (for cal_WAVE_E2DS_EA_spirou)

- Re-adjusted unit tests + added new recipes

- Improve plotting for cal_CCF plot (inputs added)

- Plotting font/style added to allow changing plot font/style/theme for all
  plots (allows presentation style plots to easily be produced)
