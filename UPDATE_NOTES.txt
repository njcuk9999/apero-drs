Update Note Summary - Version 0.4.007 (Since 0.3.050)

Done:


- updates to cal_WAVE (NEW and E2DS_EA) to try to improve littrow and
     at the very least give more output to user (NOT WORKING FULLY)

- re-working of cal_SHAPE
    - new code for cal_SHAPE that now requires the following input:
           cal_SHAPE_spirou.py HC_FILE FP_FILE1 FP_FILE2 ...

- Francois/Melissa changes to cal_wave/cal_CCF_E2DS_FP_spirou

- parallisation updates:
    - major redo of WLOG to handle multiple instances of the DRS running at once
    - updated the calibDB and telluDB reading/writing to handle multiple
      reads at once
    - updated the fits file and fits table file reading to handle multiple reads
      at once
    - updated unit_test and extract_trigger to be parallisable

- obj_mk_obj_template.py now lists wave solution in header (as well as BERV
    and filename)

- fixed bug in spirouBERV - should not be calculated for non-science OBJECTS

- fixed format of LSD table in pol table - now is a fits table
        Note to open fits tables in IDL see here:
        https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/pro/fits_table/aaareadme.txt

        lookup:
            ftab_print, 'file.fits'
        read:
            tab = readfits('file.fits', hdr, /EXTEN)
            col1 = tbget(hdr, tab, 'COLUMN1')

- extract_trigger.py written to reprocess data based on night/recipes required
      (currently located in SpirouDRS/spirouUnitTests/)

- pep8 clean up of all codes + some clean-up of which log messages are "info"
   as opposed to "general"

- many smaller bug fixes (see CHANGELOG.md)
