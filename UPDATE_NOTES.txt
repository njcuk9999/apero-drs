Update Note Summary - Version 0.3.024 (Since 0.3.017)

Not done/not finished/to do:

- integrate Etiennes new "shape finding" algorithm [Branch = extract_redo]
- integrate Etiennes new "shape finding" on extraction  [Branch = extract_redo]
- cal_WAVE_E2DS/cal_HC_E2DS versions merging
- update input system [internal no effect to devs/users]
- allow plot saving [internal no effect to devs/users]
- module generification [internal no effect to devs/users]

Done:

- Fix issue #464: DRIFT codes input files now allowed:
    - Fiber AB/A/B: FP_FP
    - Fiber AB/A/B: HCONE_HCONE
    - Fiber AB/A/B: HCTWO_HCTWO
    - Fiber C: FP_FP and OBJ_FP
    - Fiber C: HCONE_HCONE and OBJ_HCONE
    - Fiber C: HCTWO_HCTWO and OBJ_HCTWO

- Fix issue #468: Wave solution functions merged - now should ONLY use
  "GetWaveSolution" in recipes (though internal functions exist to do the
  individual operations like get wave params from header or generate wave map
  from wave params etc.

- Fix issue #471: Filenames of all inputs added to headers of outputs
  (and passed to future outputs) i.e. new header keys are:
        - DARKFILE
        - BADFILE1
        - BADFILE2
        - LOCOFILE
        - TILTFILE
        - BLAZFILE
        - FLATFILE
        - EXTRFILE
        - REFRFILE
        - WAVEFILE
        - INFILE
        - HCFILE
        - FPFILE
    These can of course be changes as with other header keys in
    spirouKeywords.py (located in directory .../INTROOT/SpirouDRS/spirouConfig/)

- Constant added to force re-computation of line list
  (for cal_WAVE_E2DS_EA_spirou)

- Re-adjusted unit tests

- Improve plotting for cal_CCF plot (inputs added)

- Plotting font/style added to allow changing plot font/style/theme for all
  plots (allows presentation style plots to easily be produced)
