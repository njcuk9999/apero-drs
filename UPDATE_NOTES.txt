Update Note Summary - Version 0.3.033 (Since 0.3.027)



Not done/not finished/to do:

- cal_WAVE_E2DS_spirou [Melissa] - DO NOT USE YET
- drift code compatibility [Francois]
- add the drift to cal_CCF [Francois]
- obj_mk_obj_template needs testing [Etienne & Neil]
- not put a constraint on FF that must match extraction type [Neil]



Done:

- added ability to use tellurics from multiple wavelength solutions in:
    - obj_mk_tellu.py
    - obj_fit_tellu.py
    - obj_mk_obj_template.py

- updated obj_mk_obj_template.py (was out of date for the DRS + untests + bugs)

- made cal_HC_E2DS_EA_spirou.py more stable (added additional sigma clipping)

- fixed bug in getting wave parameters from header

- added Eder's changes for pol_spirou

- fixed major bug with extraction methods 4a and 4b
    - methods 4a and 4b are now the default setting (change with
      ic_extract_type and ic_ff_extract_type

- moved cal_WAVE_E2DS_spirou and cal_HC_E2DS_spirou to misc folder

- force fiber A and fiber B to use wavelength solution from fiber AB

- added a "un-summed" [E2DSLL] output from extraction to view how the image
  looks after localisation + shape correction (before flattening/cosmic correction)

- DARK_FP is now available for use on drift recipes

- OBJ_DARK (Sky) is now available for use on cal_DARK_spirou.py
    - will add "SKYDARK" to calibDB
    - change "use_skydark_correction = True" to use sky darks in calibDB if
      available - note if set to True will ALWAYS use SKYDARK over DARK to use
      DARK again must set "use_skydark_correction = False"

- Fixed bug with cal_HC_E2DS_EA_spirou not saving parameters to header

- Added feature for cal_HC_E2DS_EA_spirou to update input file header
