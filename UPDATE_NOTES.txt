Update Note Summary - Version 0.3.037 (Since 0.3.027)


Not done/not finished/to do:

- problem with shift with wavelength solution found in obj_mk_obj_template
    - is this a problem with the template making process?
    - is this a problem with the wavelength solutions?
    - is this a problem with the calibDB from CFHT?
    ---> pointing toward from with calibDB from CFHT

Done:

- new recipe cal_DRIFTCCF_E2DS_spirou - input same as cal_DRIFT_E2DS_spirou
    - uses CCF of the FP_FP / OBJ_FP / DARK_FP with a cross-correlation to
      calculate drift

- update to cal_WAVE_E2DS_EA_spirou (FP jump analysis now more stable)
    However still problems with quality control criteria

- telluric update:
    - will reject objects from mk_tellu if SNR > 100 in order 35 (these can be
      changed using "qc_tellu_snr_order" and "qc_tellu_snr_min"
	- will now only use most recent obj template
	- will now only use unique TELL_OBJ filenames

- constaints on extraction that extraction type is the same as for FLAT file
  (i.e. 4a and 4b are compatible, mode 3d and 4b are not)

- added ability to use tellurics from multiple wavelength solutions in:
    - obj_mk_tellu.py
    - obj_fit_tellu.py
    - obj_mk_obj_template.py

- updated obj_mk_obj_template.py (was out of date for the DRS + untests + bugs)

- made cal_HC_E2DS_EA_spirou.py more stable (added additional sigma clipping)

- fixed bug in getting wave parameters from header

- added Eder's changes for pol_spirou

- fixed major bug with extraction methods 4a and 4b
    - methods 4a and 4b are now the default setting (change with
      ic_extract_type and ic_ff_extract_type)

- moved cal_WAVE_E2DS_spirou and cal_HC_E2DS_spirou to misc folder

- force fiber A and fiber B to use wavelength solution from fiber AB

- added a "un-summed" [E2DSLL] output from extraction to view how the image
  looks after localisation + shape correction (before flattening/cosmic correction)

- DARK_FP is now available for use on drift recipes

- OBJ_DARK (Sky) is now available for use on cal_DARK_spirou.py
    - will add "SKYDARK" to calibDB
    - change "use_skydark_correction = True" to use sky darks in calibDB if
      available - note if set to True will ALWAYS use SKYDARK over DARK to use
      DARK again must set "use_skydark_correction = False"

- Fixed bug with cal_HC_E2DS_EA_spirou not saving parameters to header

- Added feature for cal_HC_E2DS_EA_spirou to update input file header
