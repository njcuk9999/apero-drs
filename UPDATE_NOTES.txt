# Update Note Summary - Version 0.6.063

correction to CCF
	- fixed problem with gaps in splinesfixed problem with normalisation (leading to bad average ccf)
	- fixed: using RV from header if available (header key OBJRV)
		- for the mini data set OBJRV is either unset or -9999.99?
		- if unset or -9999.99 defaults to zero
	- fixed: change default mask: masque_sept18_andres_trans50_AB.fits
	- fixed: added other masks (see apero/data/spirou/ccf)

added leak calibration
	- create master using >> cal_leak_master_spirou.py {master_night_name}
	- mini data has no dark_fp so master is provided by default
	- correct spectra by using >> cal_leak_spirou.py {night_name} {e2dsff + OBJ_FP}
	- original spectra are over written by correction

default calibration database mode is now "older" (was "closest") - masters are exempt from this
	- Note "older" didn't work in previous versions  with the master - now every key in the calibDB has a 1 or 0 to denote whether it is a master calibration or not and is exempt of the "older" rule - but will still be choosen in a "closest" fashion.
	- master codes now require an additional argument --master=True to run correctly
changes to apero_processing:
	- apero_processing now produces a clean list of which files were run (see /runs/stats/APEROL-{PID}_apero_processing_stats.txt
	- I've cleaned up the "run.ini" files (you'll note they no longer have the same name as sequences)
	- "mini_run.ini" is the template run.ini you should use for apero_processing - but please copy it and rename it before using it
	- i.e. >> apero_processing.py SPIROU mini_run.iniadded changes to allow trigger functionality (trigger mode) i.e. stop processing when correct files aren't found yet
tools
	- added the mtl_sync code (also on apero-drs/utils
	- added a new profile code: setup/newprofile.py  - used to copy current profile
		- easiest way to switch between user_config.ini / user_constants.ini
		- >> setup/newprofile.py --name=mysetup
		- Then you can switch between default and new setup by having multiple aliases
		- i.e. i have "setup_test" and "setup_mini" and "setup_full"  - each going to separate "reduced"/"tmp"/"calibDB" directories
		- note this also means one could have multiple versions of the drs running at once just by changing the paths in *.bash.setup or *.sh.setup etc
		- must have installed via setup/install.py and be in an activate environment (i.e. have sourced the default apero.bash.setup)
bug fixes:
	- lock printouts only for warnings (unless in debug mode) -- cleans up display
	- added drs key DRSOBJN (a drs clean version of OBJECT header key) -- should fix spaces in object names issue
	- fixed cores = 1 bug
