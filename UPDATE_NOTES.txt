Update Note Summary - Version 0.4.072 (Since 0.4.009)

Not Done:

- No integration of Melissa's new wave code

Done:

- changes to the telluric recipes

    obj_mk_tellu_new  - this is the new way to make individual aborption maps from the telluric hot stars
    obj_mk_tellu_db - this is a wrapper for the whole telluric process i.e.:
        obj_mk_tellu_new [on all e2dsff files in telluric white list]
        obj_fit_tellu [on all e2dsff files in telluric white list]
        obj_mk_obj_template [on all objects in telluric white list]
        obj_mk_tellu_new [on all e2dsff files in telluric white list]

- changes to pre-processing - corrupt files should now not be saved

    Note: as with all other QC the trigger will have to deal with missing files
    Note: log warning messages are given in the standard QC fashion

- added option to plot to file (requested by Claire for meta data)

    Note: one MUST update any config file with the plot option:
        0 = No plots
        1 = plot to screen
        2 = plot to file
    Note: one MUST update any config file to set a "plot path":
        DRS_DATA_PLOT = '/home/data/plots/'
    Note: if these two steps are not done the drs will crash

- an INTROOT2 folder will be created - please ignore this for now
