To better understand the variables in the DRS we have laid out each variable in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\item \ParameterEntry{Variable title}{Description of the variable}{VARIABLE\_NAME}
{Default Value}{The code used a variable is used in}{The place where the variable can be found}
{
Who should be able to change this variable, levels are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Public: Everyone (including the user)
	\item Private: Only the developer
\end{itemize}
}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item \ParameterEntry{DRS Name}
{Defines the data reduction software name}
{DRS\_NAME}{SPIROU}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}{Public}
\DevNote{Currently Public variable should be private.}

\item \ParameterEntry{Plotting switch}
{Defines whether to show plots (A value of 1 to show plots, a value of 0 to not show plots)}
{DRS\_PLOT}{1}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{Print message level}
{The level of messages to print, values can be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item "all" -- prints all events
	\item "info" -- prints info, warning and error events
	\item "warning" -- prints warning and error events
	\item "error" -- print only error events
\end{itemize}
}
{PRINT\_LEVEL}{all}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{Log message level}
{The level of messages to print, values can be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item "all" -- prints all events
	\item "info" -- prints info, warning and error events
	\item "warning" -- prints warning and error events
	\item "error" -- print only error events
\end{itemize}
}
{LOG\_LEVEL}{all}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}


\end{itemize}

\label{ch:variables:directory}

These were mentioned in Section \ref{ch:install:setup} and are located in teh `\configtxtfile' file. The `\configtxtfile' file is located in the \InstallDIR in the config folder (i.e. at \InstallDIR{/config/config.txt}). \\

Currently the directory variables are:

\begin{itemize}

\item \ParameterEntry{The data directory}
{Defines the path to the data directory}
{TDATA}{/drs/data/}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{The installation directory}
{Defines the instllation directory (\InstallDIR)}
{DRS\_ROOT}{/drs/INTROOT/}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{The raw data directory}
{Defines the directory that the reduced data should be saved to/read from}
{DRS\_DATA\_RAW}{/drs/data/raw}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{The reduced data directory}
{Defines the directory that the reduced data should be saved to/read from}
{DRS\_DATA\_REDUC}{/drs/data/reduced}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{The calibration database and calibration file directory}
{Defines the directory that the calibration files and database should be saved to/read from}
{DRS\_CALIB\_DB}{/drs/data/calibDB}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{The log directory}
{Defines the directory that the log messages are stored in}
{DRS\_DATA\_MSG}{/drs/data/msg}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\item \ParameterEntry{The working directory}
{Defines the working directory}
{DRS\_DATA\_WORKING}{/drs/data/tmp/}{All Recipes}{\configtxtfile}

\end{itemize}
