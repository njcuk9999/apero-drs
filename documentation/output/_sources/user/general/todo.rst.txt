=========================================
APERO
=========================================

For all instruments / in general.

High priority:

* add in `dark_fp` correction
* fix headers for having bad wave and loc keys (remove?)
* fix s1d for `FP_FP` and `HC_HC` they need updating after wave sol produced
* add rv from header for ccf
* add version for instruments (separate from apero version which will change with any update)
* code to get data sets from rsync

Low priority:

* go through all summary plots and decide which plots, write figure captions, improve plots, write quality control description, decide which header keys to print
* add all functions doc strings
* write documentation

  * code to write constants/keywords
  * write doc strings
  * autodoc with sphinx once doc strings are in
  * assign people to write constant descriptions
  * add authors to constants

* add more debug printouts
* deal with all python warnings
* display func for all functions
* add doc strings to all functions, descriptions to all constants, review all constant min/max/dtypes
* proper SNR calculation
* defining night_name in run.ini scripts does not work
* add option to set template for mk_tellu and fit_tellu
* add flag for parellel / non parellel mode - can disable locking then?
* named break points
* add trigger option to drs where processing script stops when it cannot get any further with current set of files

Later:

* CCF wrapper for weighting?
* persistence correction
* add EA mask generation from templates
* add EA template matching
* uncertainty propagation
* data separate download from DRS
* add `plot== 3` (all debug plots shown) and `plot==4` (all debug plots saved) modes
* move `object_query_list.fits` to `calibDB`
* co-production of e2ds and e2dsff still needed?
* write  paper
* setup instrument tool
* Windows compatibility
* add `cal_drift` recipe?


=========================================
SPIRou specific
=========================================
High priority:

* trigger implementation / interface with drs
* add exposure meter recipes (`cal_exposuremeter_spirou.py`)

Low priority:

* output files like CFHT (e.fits, p.fits, v.fits etc)
* finish `obj_spec_spirou` and `obj_pol_spirou` [Do not use them now]
* output in form required for CFHT/CADC (discussion required)

Later:

* None


=========================================
NIRPS specific
=========================================
High priority:

* convert cal_shape_master
* convert cal_shape
* convert cal_flat
* convert cal_extract

Low priority:

* convert obj_mk_tellu
* convert obj_fit_tellu
* convert obj_mk_template

Later:

* T.B.D.
