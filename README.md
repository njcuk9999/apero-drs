[Back to top](#apero---a-pipeline-to-reduce-observations)

- master (long term stable) V0.6.131 (2020-09-10)
    ```
    This is the version currently recommended for all general use. It may not
    contain the most up-to-date features until long term support and stability can
    be verified.
    ```
- developer (tested) V0.7.205 (2022-02-11)
    ```
    Note the developer version should have been tested and semi-stable but not
    ready for full sets of processing and defintely not for release for
    non-developers or for data put on archives. Some changes may not be
    in this version that are in the working version.
    ```
- working (untested) V0.7.205 (2022-02-11)
    ```
    Note the working version will be the most up-to-date version but has not been
    tested for stability - use at own risk.
    ```
