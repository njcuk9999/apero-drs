[Back to top](#apero---a-pipeline-to-reduce-observations)

- main (long term stable) V0.7.275 (2023-01-30)
    ```
    This is the version currently recommended for all general use. It may not
    contain the most up-to-date features until long term support and stability can
    be verified.
    ```
- developer (tested) V0.7.283 (2023-05-23)
    ```
    Note the developer version should have been tested and semi-stable but not
    ready for full sets of processing and defintely not for release for
    non-developers or for data put on archives. Some changes may not be
    in this version that are in the working version.
    ```
- stable-test (tested) V0.7.283 (2023-05-23)
    ```
    Notrmally up-to-date with the live version has been or is currently
    being tested for stability
    ```
- live (untested) V0.8.??? (2022-01-30)
    ```
    Note the live version will be the most up-to-date version but has not been
    tested for stability - use at own risk.
    ```
