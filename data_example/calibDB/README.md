# Calibration database

This file is where all calibration files that pass the quality control will be put.

These are managed in 'ref_calib_SPIROU.txt' in the following format

```
  key foldername filename time-human time-unix
```

This path and the calibration database filename can be changed in ```{DRS_UCONFIG}/{INSTRUMENT}/user_config.ini```
