# Raw data folder

Raw file should be placed here within a sub-folder consisting of (at least) the date of observation.

i.e. 

- /data/raw/
- /data/raw/20170710/
- /data/raw/20170710/raw_fits_file1.fits
- /data/raw/20170710/raw_fits_file2.fits
- /data/raw/20170710/raw_fits_file3.fits


These paths can be changed in ```/INTROOT/config/config.py```
