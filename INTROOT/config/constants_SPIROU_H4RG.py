#        Lines must either start with a # or be a key-value pair or be a blank
#            line, blank lines and lines that start with a # will be ignored
#
#        Key value pairs are of the form:
#                 key = value
#
#        Note python will try to interpret values so basic math is allowed:
#
#        i.e.   x = 10 + 10
#
#        will be interpreted in the parameter dictionary (p) as:
#
#        p['x'] = 100
#
#        and will be an integer.
#
#        Interpretation works as in eval('10 + 10')
#
#            [Try it in python for the result that will be passed to the
