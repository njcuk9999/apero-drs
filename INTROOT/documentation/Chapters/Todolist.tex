%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Below is the current to do list and any things that need to be addressed before release.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
\section{General}
\label{ch:todo:general}
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
	\item Write help files for each recipe (In \InstallDIR/man filenames should be `recipe name'.info)
	\item Need to sort out public and private variables (and keywords), some variables not needed to be changed by user -- private and public configuration files
	\item Should have user configuration file too, for example, \textcolor{blue}{/home/\$user/.spirou\_config} and call the default values from a private location
	\item Check configuration variable values are valid at start-up of recipes (avoids crashes later)
	\item \textcolor{red}{Can we remove `special\_config\_SPIROU' configuration file call as the file does not exist?}
	\item \textcolor{red}{fitsfilename is the last file in a group of files - is this correct or should it be the first (as initially defined)?}
	\item \textcolor{red}{`nbcos' in \spirouImage is not used - what is it?}
	\item \textcolor{red}{`image\_gap' in \spirouLOCOR is set to zero, what is this?}
	\item \textcolor{red}{Some keywords added to header but not updated in any recipe - should they be removed (or updated)?}
	\item Write a set-up.py installer / checker for prerequisites (Last step)
\end{itemize}
