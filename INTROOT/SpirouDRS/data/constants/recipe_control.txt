# This is the recipe control document
#
# Columns must be as follows:
#     Recipe        = full name of recipe (without .py)          
#     Number        = Number of files assiociated with recipe
#                     Note multiple of same number for same recipe works as "or" 
#                     i.e. cal_loc_RAW_spirou can take flat_dark OR dark_flat
#     ocode         = odometer code (will be checked for in pre-processing to set 
#                     unique_string and dprtype) if None not checked in pre-processing
#     obstype       = OBSTYPE HEADER key (will be checked for in pre-processing 
#                     to set unique_string and dprtype) if None not checked for in
#                     pre-processing
#     ccas          = AB fiber type code, if None not checked for in pre-processing
#     cref          = C fiber type code, if None not checked for in pre-processing
#     fiber         = if set identifies the type of fiber to user, i.e. FIBER parmeter
#                     if None fiber is not set
#     dprtype       = the value of DPRTYPE set in the HEADER (after identification 
#                     in pre-processing), if None DPRTYPE not set
#     dstring       = the unique string "suffix" to add in pre-processing, if None
#                     not added in pre-processing, this is the string looked for
#                     when recipe runs
#     kind          = whether a file is a Raw file [RAW] or Reduced file [REDUC] if
#                     Raw file will be required to have the pre-processing suffix
#                     when recipe runs
#     desc          = single word description for the recipe (used in logging when 
#                     recipe runs)
